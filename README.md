<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Surf Report

A web tool to get the latest surf report for any beach in the world!

This project came out of a personal need for an app that was quick to check, and provided just the most important data for my surf trips. 

What you can do:
* Use the map to find your local beach.
* Click "lets surf" and navigate through the days to see the surf report for each day.
* The main screen provides averages throughout that day, and the hourly report can be accessed below the map.
